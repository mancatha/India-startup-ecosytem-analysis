# India-startup-ecosytem-analysis
Analyzing funding by startup in India 
This is one of our Team projects to complete in our first LP1 sprint. The purpose of this project is for the team to showcase their knowledge and skills acquired throughout the Bot Camp.
The data for the analysis is a four-csv zipped file that contains data on India's start-up funding from 2018 to 2021. The source of the data is known to the Project Manager.
 Ask
In this phase, we define the business understanding objective, develop our hypothesis, raise questions to help accept or reject the hypothesis, and get some general insights into the data. 
Business understanding
This project focuses on the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. Our objective is to analyse the data and help management make informed decisions in terms of where to locate in India and possible funding we can attract. 
Hypothesis
Null hypotheses: the location of a business doesnâ€™t affect the amount of funding received from investors.
Alternate hypothesis: The location of a business significantly affects the amount of funding issued by investors.
 Questions
1.	To what extent do cities influence funding?
2.	Which sectors are preferred by investors for funding?
3.	At which stage do start-ups get more funding from investors?
4.	What is the typical funding amount that startups receive in India?
5.	Which type of investor invests the most money?
